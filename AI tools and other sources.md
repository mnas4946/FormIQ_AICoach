**AI use**
AI Tools and Sources Used
For this project, we used ChatGPT and Cursor AI alongside other academic sources to validate our findings and research regarding physiotherapy patients. We also used two other AI models: 
MoveNet and Yolo to extract “ideal/correct” keypoints from reference images and videos and also to detect key points and thus any movement from users' webcam. ChatGPT was primarily used 
to build the foundation of our code, including the rule-based logic, extracting keypoints from exercise videos, and creating our own dataset. It helped us understand how the code works 
by breaking down functionality, highlighting what each section does, and allowing us to add code we didn’t fully understand before. Essentially, it acted as both a coding assistant and a 
learning tool, making the technical aspects much clearer.

Cursor AI was used primarily for front-end development, leveraging our existing experience in HTML and CSS. It was particularly helpful for generating interface code quickly, though ChatGPT 
was still necessary to understand and modify sections of code that Cursor generated.We also incorporated academic articles for research, competitor analysis, and to inform our choice of tools. 
On the AI model side, we used MoveNet to train autoencoders on exercise videos for pose estimation, and YoloV8 for real-time detection in our system. This combination of tools reflects the unit’s 
philosophy of using whatever resources necessary to achieve high-quality results, while ensuring full understanding of the processes involved.
